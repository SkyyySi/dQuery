# dQuery

## Desciption

A small, light-weight and kinda scuffed, jQuery-like JavaScript library.

## Why?

Two reasons:

  1. Cause' why not ;') - I mean, what the world really needs right now is another sh\*tty JavaScript library, right?
  2. I wanted to learn how to use JavaScript (as in: Vanilla JavaScript, not jQuery, React, etc.), and I felt like this might be a more interesting way to learn some of the basics than the "typical stuff" that is also not really that hard nor very different from other programming languages.
  3. jQuery is amazing, but was build for a time where every web browser had a completely different API, in addition to being made to do a ton of stuff. This is written in modern JS with only a small scope of the few things one *really* needs all the time.
